# basic-auth-website
This project is a basic authentication system built using Node.js, Express.js, and JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication. The frontend is a simple HTML page with JavaScript (using Axios for API requests).

Features:
✅ User Signup: Users can create an account with a username and password.
✅ User Sign-in: Authenticates users and generates a JWT token for session management.
✅ Protected Route (/me): Retrieves user information only if authenticated.
✅ LocalStorage Token Handling: Stores the JWT token in the browser to maintain sessions.
✅ Basic Middleware: Implements logging and authentication middleware for security.
